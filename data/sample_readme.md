# Results Expected

1. Write all your code in one well-commented Python file; briefly mention the insights and observations from the analysis
2. Present the overall approach of the analysis in a presentation:
    a. Mention the problem statement and the analysis approach briefly
    b. Explain the results of univariate, bivariate analysis etc. in business terms
    c. Include visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation

You need to submit one Ipython notebook which clearly explains the thought process behind your analysis (either in comments of markdown text), code and relevant plots.

Important Note: Please make sure to rename your Python notebook "Group_Facilitator_Name.ipynb".

You need to submit a GitHub repository link that contains the files above . You need to write a README.md for the GitHub repository.  You can follow the video below to understand how to create the GitHub repository. Make sure your GitHub link is public.
